## Fracture dynamics of correlated percolation on ionomer networks.

My PhD project is to study fracture (crack) dynamics on a polymer network. The practicical goal is to predict the lifetime of the polymer network, but as it can be modelled on a random network, so it is basically a mathematical random graph problem. As the random fracture process is a Markov process, the dynamics is numerically simulated in Python and implemented with a kinetic Monte Carlo method.

During the dynamics, we focused on locating a spanning or percolating clusters in the network. This is solved by implementing an efficient tree-based algorithm. 

This code is a whole process of how the stochastic dynamics of the network is simulated in Python.
